CoCo is a preprocessor for the Fortran language.

The version in this repository is adapted to be able to process NONMEM
control files.

The original CoCo was written by Dan Nagle and is available at
http://www.daniellnagle.com/coco.html. On that page there is a link to
the Gnu Public License version 3.0. For convenience and reference,
the original source is located in the "orgsrc" directory.

The documentation on the CoCo website was converted to bookdown and
the resulting book is located in the "book" directory; the generated
pdf is located in the "doc" directory. For now, all information about
Fortran was retained even if it is likely to be irrelevant for NONMEM
(or for present versions of Fortran).

A chapter was added to the manual (Chapter 11) to illustrate
how a preprocessor might be useful with NONMEM.
