To download the source code for the CoCo program, click
[CoCo preprocessor](http://www.daniellnagle.com/pub/coco.tar.gz).
As CoCo has grown in size and complexity, it is now desirable to
maintain CoCo as several modules rather than one large program. Thus,
CoCo is now a gzipped tarfile containing the source files and a
makefile. The makefile is set to use gfortran as the compiler, but
also has macros for ifort and nagfor. You should be able to configure
it for other compilers as well. You may want to use the free
[F2KCLI](http://www.winteracter.com/f2kcli)
Module from I.S.S. Ltd. to compile the CoCo program if your compiler
doesn't support the Fortran 2003 command line access intrinsic
procedures. Download the
[restore](http://www.daniellnagle.com/pub/restore.f90)
program which can undo CoCo processing under limited circumstances. The
[env2inc](http://www.daniellnagle.com/pub/env2inc.f90)
program is also available.
